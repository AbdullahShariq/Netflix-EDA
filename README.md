#  Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis

##  Project Description

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, leveraging powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective is to derive meaningful insights and uncover hidden patterns within the dataset by performing thorough data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

Through this analysis, we examine key aspects of Netflix's content library, including the distribution between Movies and TV Shows, temporal trends in content release over the years, variations in content production across different countries, and runtime/duration patterns. By visually representing these patterns, the project aims to highlight content preferences, geographic production diversity, and how Netflix's offerings have evolved over time.

This EDA serves as a foundational step in understanding the structure of entertainment datasets and can be extended to drive further applications like recommendation systems, trend forecasting, or content strategy analysis. The project is a great demonstration of how data science can be applied to real-world entertainment industry data to extract actionable insights.
